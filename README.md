## Industrial Control System Critical Node Identification

This is my Critical Node Identification Program for Industrial Control System (based on Tennessee Eastman Process).  
Including two different algorithms: my algorithm and Jiang's algorithm(as a comparison).
  
The calculation results are in the relative_closeness directory
